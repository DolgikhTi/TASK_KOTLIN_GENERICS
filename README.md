Generic functions:

Learn about generic functions. Make the code compile by implementing a partitionTo function that splits a collection into two collections according to the predicate.
There is a partition() function in the standard library that always returns two newly created lists. Write a function that splits the collection into two collections given as arguments. The signature of the toCollection() function from the standard library might help you.
